# Notes

### Claiming System (Colonies)

#### unicode symbols

### Protection
- Locking Skills: when a player joins and is in survival/not another game mode he gets a flag like `player.core.experience.enabled`  
which allows him to level up in skills etc.
- Otherwise he gets the flag `player.core.experience.disabled` and some events will be cancelled with flagged argument  
example:  
`player absorbs experience flagged:player.core.experience.disabled:  
  - determine cancelled`

### teleport Pillars

- Teleport to fixed destinations that have a monument (pillars) using advanced soul magic
- Monuments mostly ruined
- Player gets burned when touching blocks of ruined monuments (which are not working anymore)

### colonies

- leveling colonies up can only be done once a day
- firework effects when leveling up and colonizing
