# Moepius' Denizen Scripts

This repo contains a collection of all the Denizen scripts I'm currently working on.  
Denizen is a scripting language plugin for Spigot servers, allowing for fast customization <https://github.com/DenizenScript/Denizen>. 
Be aware that these scripts are used on a German Minecraft Server <https://www.craftasy.de>, so most of my scripts contain German text.  
Since it's an ongoing project, expect things to be broken or not working at all - **you've been warned**.
I'm using some external scripts provided by the Denizen community, you can find them in the `external` folder.

Additional information about the Denizen scripting language can be found on the official website <https://denizenscript.com>
