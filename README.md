# Moepius' Denizen Scripts

This repo contains a collection of all the Denizen scripts I'm currently working on.
Denizen is a scripting language plugin for Spigot servers, allowing for fast customization <https://github.com/DenizenScript/Denizen>
Be aware that these scripts are used on a German Minecraft Server <https://www.craftasy.de>, so most of my scripts contain German text. 
Since it's an ongoing project, expect things to be broken or not working at all - **you've been warned**.
I'm using some external scripts provided by the Denizen community, you can find them in the `external` folder.

Additional information about the Denizen scripting language can be found on the official website <https://denizenscript.com>

# How to use

1. Make sure your server is running on the latest Paper version - <https://papermc.io/downloads>
2. Download and install the latest version of the Denizen Plugin - <https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/denizen.21039>
3. Download all desired folders, or `.dsc` files containing Denizen scripts
4. Put them into your `/plugins/Denizen/scripts` folder
5. Log in to your server and use the command `/ex reload`
6. Enjoy
